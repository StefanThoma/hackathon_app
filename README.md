# hackathon application

This is the public version of a shiny app that allows users to register a team and subsequently upload a script which produces dataset. 
The script is run on the server and should access files in the folder `adam/` and `sdtm/`.

Please find more information in my recent [blog post](https://stefanthoma.github.io/quarto-blog/posts/2023-03-14_shiny_script_upload/).
